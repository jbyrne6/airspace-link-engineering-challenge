### Current State

My approach for the initial version of this application is to demonstrate the basic functionality of determining flight approval. The current state of the application is able to tell you if your flight plan would be accepted or denied, and if it was denied how much area is in a restricted zone.

### Future additions to functionality
1. Be able to create multiple flight plans at once and see their details indipendently.
2. Create a popup feature to see details of flight plans as well as a table giving more detailed info on all flight plans made.
3. Have the no-fly-zone area overlap update automatically as flight plans move, are added, and deleted.
4. Make flight plans area (blue) be grouped with the no-fly zone overlap (red) so that both polygons can be deleted at once.
5. Create API to handle "Can I Fly" logic.
6. Toggle visibility of the different geometries drawn.
